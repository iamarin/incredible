This project is to create a visual application using Dash. We are using information from an
article about it. But we recommend you to visit the main page, located at https://dash.plotly.com/introduction.

## Components

So far we did not see any of the components that dash is made of. First we need to notice that
as Flask, **we need to star the application creating an app object**, we can make it as follows


```
app=dash.Dash()

```
